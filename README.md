### Type of Application
This is a Standalone console application build using .NET Framework 4.7.2 on Visual Studio 2019. Open the BLECode2 project.

### Aim of Application
This was build to get an understanding of how to communicate with the BLE GATT server of the Xsens DOT sensors in isolation to the complexities of Unity.

### Capabilities
1. Discover the nearby BLE devices & list them
2. Identify and Connect to the Xsens DOTs (max of 2 only)
3. List the services of the DOTs
4. List the battery characteristic and read its value (for only one sensor)
5. List the streaming characteristic, read its value and subscribe to receive updates (for only one sensor)

### Issues
The project seems to be broken at the moment (15/10/2022) but it is still a valuable resource in understanding how to communicate with a BLE device. Will fix it if I get to it.
